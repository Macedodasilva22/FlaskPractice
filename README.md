# FlaskPractice

This project aims to create a fun and interactive meme website using Flask and an external API. The website dynamically fetches random memes from an API and displays them to users. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance the user interface, allowing users to enjoy fresh memes with a click of a button. The goal is to provide an engaging platform for meme enthusiasts to discover and share humorous content from various sources.
